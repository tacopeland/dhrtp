# Digital Hazards Random Teleport Bukkit plugin

A random teleport plugin based on the work of [dpasi](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/random-teleport) but adjusted for use on modded Minecraft servers.
Currently works on CraftBukkit 1.7.10.
*Only works properly on servers with mods that change surface world generation if chunks are pregenerated.*
